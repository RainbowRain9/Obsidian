**Directions:** Suppose your university is planning to launch a new student club, and you are tasked with writing a proposal for its establishment. Include the club's name, objectives, planned activities, and the benefits it will bring to the students. You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.

**Proposal for Establishing the English Learning Club**

To further enhance the language skills of our student body, it is recommended to establish a new student organization named the "English Learning Club" at our university. The primary objective of this club will be to improve students' English proficiency and foster a deeper appreciation for the English language through a variety of engaging activities.

The English Learning Club will organize a range of activities, including English conversation practice sessions, movie nights featuring English-language films, and workshops dedicated to grammar and vocabulary enhancement. Additionally, guest speakers, such as native English speakers and language experts, will be invited to share their insights and experiences. These activities will provide students with ample opportunities to practice and refine their English skills in a stimulating and supportive environment.

The establishment of the English Learning Club will bring numerous benefits to the student community. It will create a platform for students to actively engage in language learning, thereby improving their English proficiency and boosting their confidence in using the language. Furthermore, the club will foster a sense of community and collaboration as students work together to achieve their linguistic goals. Through these activities, members will develop enhanced communication skills and a greater appreciation for the English language and its associated cultures.

关于建立英语学习俱乐部的提案

为了进一步提高学生的语言能力，建议在我校建立一个新的学生组织，名为“英语学习俱乐部”。这个俱乐部的主要目标是通过各种有吸引力的活动来提高学生的英语水平和培养对英语的更深层次的欣赏。

英语学习俱乐部将组织一系列的活动，包括英语会话练习，英语电影之夜，以及致力于语法和词汇增强的讲习班。此外，将邀请英语母语人士和语言专家等演讲嘉宾分享他们的见解和经验。这些活动将为学生提供充足的机会，在一个激励和支持的环境中练习和提高他们的英语技能。

英语学习俱乐部的成立将给学生群体带来许多好处。它将为学生创造一个积极参与语言学习的平台，从而提高他们的英语水平，增强他们使用语言的信心。此外，俱乐部将培养社区意识和合作，因为学生们一起努力实现他们的语言目标。通过这些活动，会员将提高沟通技巧，提高对英语及其相关文化的欣赏。
