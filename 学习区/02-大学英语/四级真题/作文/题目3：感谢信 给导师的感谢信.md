Dear Professor Lee,

亲爱的李教授:

My name is Li Ming, and I recently completed my internship at Luckin Coffee under your supervision. I am writing this letter to express my heartfelt gratitude for the incredible opportunity and guidance you provided during my internship.

我叫李明，最近在您的指导下完成了在瑞幸咖啡的实习。我写这封信是为了衷心感谢您在我实习期间给我提供的难得的机会和指导。

First and foremost, thank you for your unwavering support and mentorship. I have learned a great deal about the coffee industry, customer service, and coffee making skills, which has significantly enhanced my understanding of café operations. Your insights and feedback were invaluable and have helped me grow both professionally and personally.

首先，感谢您始终如一的支持和指导。我学到了很多关于咖啡行业、客户服务和咖啡制作技巧的知识，这大大提高了我对咖啡运营的理解。你的见解和反馈是无价的，帮助我在专业和个人方面都有所成长。

Additionally, the experience has equipped me with practical skills such as effective communication, time management, and advanced coffee-making techniques, which I am confident will be instrumental in my future career. The hands-on experience and real-world applications have given me a solid foundation to pursue my goals in the hospitality industry.

此外，这段经历使我具备了有效的沟通、时间管理和先进的咖啡制作技术等实用技能，我相信这些技能将对我未来的职业生涯起到重要作用。实践经验和实际应用为我在酒店业追求目标奠定了坚实的基础。


Thank you once again for the opportunity and guidance. I look forward to staying in touch and hope to work with you again in the future.  

再次感谢您给我的机会和指导。我期待与您保持联系，并希望在未来与您再次合作。
