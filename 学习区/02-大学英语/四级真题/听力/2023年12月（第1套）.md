Question 1 and 2

A police officer in the US stopped a large SUV car that was going very slowly and _drifting_ across lanes on a highway. He _expected_ to find a driver who was either very drunk or having a medical _emergency_. Instead, the officer discovered a five year old boy sat on the _edge_ of the driver's seat. His feet could barely _reach_ the _brake_ and his head was only just _high enough_ to see out of the windows. The child has taken the keys to the family car while his teenage sister was napping. He then drove 3 kilometers across tone before getting on the highway. The boy later told confused officers that he was planing to travel to California and buy a Lamborghini Sports Car. Although he only has 3 dollar in his wallet, at least he was driving in the right _direction_.

But we already know this what we have not yet understood is the way that the tinny machine in front of us are changing our skeletons. Possible altering not just the way we behave, but even the very shape of our bodies. New scientific research at the university of sunshine coast in queensland Australia, suggest that young people are developing extra pieces of bones at the backs of their heads, these pieces of bones. Are caused by the way people bend their heads when they use phone, this shifts the way onto the muscles at the back of their heads and causes the bone the grow away that is not normal. This process can beware compared to the way the skin hardens in response to constant rubbing or pressure. The result is a piece of bone like a horn that sticks out from the head by the neck.
