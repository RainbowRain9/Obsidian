**Over the past decade 过去十年**, thousands of patents have been granted for what are called business methods. Amazon.com received *one 商业用途专利* for its "one-click" online payment system.

Now the nation's top patent *court 法庭* **appears 似乎** completely **ready to 做好...准备** **scale back on 缩小...的范围** business-method patents, which have been **controversial 争议的** ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago. In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad review of business-method patents. In re <span style="background:#fff88f">Bilski</span>, as the case is known,is "***a very big deal 是一件大事***," says Dennis D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of Law.

**Curbs on （对... 的抑制）** business-method **claims(索要)** would be a dramatic <span style="background:#fff88f">about-face</span>, because it was the Federal Circuit itself *that（强调句）* introduced such patents *就是联邦巡回法院自己引入了这样的专利* with its 1998 **decision** in the so-called *State Street Bank 州立银行* case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. That ruling produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by emerging Internet companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to specific types of online transactions. Later, more established companies raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move against rivals that might beat them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in a court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method patents, despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting them. Similarly, some Wall Street investment firms armed themselves with patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court cases opposing the practice.

28. The word "about-face" (Line 1, Para. 3) most probably means

[A] loss of goodwill. *善意的消失*

[B] increase of hostility.*敌意的增加*

==[C] change of attitude.==

[D] enhancement of dignity.*尊严的提高*

The Bilski case involves a **claimed 所谓的（作者不认为/不觉得）** patent on a method for **hedging （hedge 规避）** risk in the energy market. The Federal Circuit issued an *unusual order 不同寻常的要求* stating that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court's judges, rather than a **typical 典型的** panel of three, and that one issue it wants to *evaluate 评估* is whether *it（联邦巡回法院）* should "reconsider" its State Street Bank **ruling 判决**.*（暗含当时州立银行的专利也不大需要授予）*

The Federal Circuit's action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by the Supreme Court that has **narrowed 缩小** *the scope of protections 保护范围* for *patent holders*. Last April, for example, the justices **signaled 表示** that <font color=#ed1c24>too</font> many patents were being **upheld（uphold 认可）** for "inventions" that are obvious. The judges on the Federal Circuit are "reacting to the anti-patent trend at the Supreme Court," says Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School.

^^^article

Over the past decade, thousands of patents have been granted for what are called business methods. Amazon.com received one for its "one-click" online payment system. Merrill Lynch got legal protection for an asset allocation strategy. One inventor patented a technique for lifting a box.

Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready to scale back on business-method patents, which have been controversial ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago. In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad review of business-method patents. In re Bilski, as the case is known,is "a very big deal," says Dennis D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of Law. It "has the potential to eliminate an entire class of patents."

Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it was the Federal Circuit itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 decision in the so-called State Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. That ruling produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by emerging Internet companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to specific types of online transactions. Later, more established companies raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move against rivals that might beat them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in a court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method patents, despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting them. Similarly, some Wall Street investment firms armed themselves with patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court cases opposing the practice.

The Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk in the energy market. The Federal Circuit issued an unusual order stating that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court's judges, rather than a typical panel of three, and that one issue it wants to evaluate is whether it should "reconsider" its State Street Bank ruling.

The Federal Circuit's action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by the Supreme Court that has narrowed the scope of protections for patent holders. Last April, for example, the justices signaled that too many patents were being upheld for "inventions" that are obvious. The judges on the Federal Circuit are "reacting to the anti-patent trend at the Supreme Court," says Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School.
